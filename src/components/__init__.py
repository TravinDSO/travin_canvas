Components Package for Travin Canvas

This package contains UI components for the application, including the chat interface
and markdown canvas components. These components are responsible for rendering
the user interface and handling user interactions.

Modules:
- chat.py: Implements the chat interface with LLM integration
- canvas.py: Implements the markdown editor and preview

Each component is designed to be modular and reusable, with clear interfaces
for integration with the main application. Components maintain their state
using Streamlit's session state mechanism.
